# CSC307-Receipt-App

## Overview

For our project code style guidlines, we decided to follow the general Prettier guidlines, which are listed below.

## Coding Standards

- **JavaScript/React**:

  - Indentation: 2 spaces.
  - Single quotes for strings.
  - Semicolons at the end of statements.
  - Trailing commas where possible.
  - Line length: Prettier will automatically wrap code to the configured line length (default is 80 characters).
  - Avoid magic numbers when possible
  - Use const for variables that do not change and let for those that do

- **Other Languages**: For other languages used in the project (e.g., HTML, CSS, JSON), we are using the default Prettier guidlines.
